Fixing code/bugs/features:
9. Remove scrolling from home page
14. What to do with reflexive verbs - most frequent verbs don't have them
20. Re-write functions in RandomSelector so that they operate on converted tenses and moods


Adding new features/improvements:
4. add other pages:
  - theory
  - verb conjugations search
7. use context for verbs - faster loading when moving between pages; change max value of top n popular verbs in settings
8. Split settings into multiple re-usable components (SettingContainer.tsx) and use .map() to iterate them:
  - Select moods and tenses
  - Select Persons
  - Select how many most used verbs you want to learn
10. add score
13. Make settings and home pages buttons bigger
15. Make left side of switch more highlighted
16. Start tense and mood from capital letter
17. Persons settings look ugly
18. Write more most popular verbs manually
