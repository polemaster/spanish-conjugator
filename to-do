Fixes:
20. update tsconfig.json
22. change conjugations in theory to be taken from verbs
23. Make expandable sections searchable
24. paths do not work correctly (data/*.csv are relative) - when trailing / is removed, app doesn't work

Adding new features/improvements:
4. add other pages:
  - theory
  - verb conjugations search
7. use context for verbs? - faster loading when moving between pages; change max value of top n popular verbs in settings
18. Write more most popular verbs manually
19. Add theme switch (light / dark mode)
21. Check contrast ratio between fg and bg - found indigo to have only 4.6 ratio

From MacOS:
25. Change <nav> to <header>
26. For imperative, change 3rd persons to Ud. instead of el/ella
27. Change Loading verbs... text to (in HomePage):
  return <div className="mx-auto mt-25 text-center">Loading verbs....</div>;
28. There is an error if I remove all persons from settings
29. Remove error when going to non-existent route (errorElement prop)
30. Change Link to NavLink to track active page
