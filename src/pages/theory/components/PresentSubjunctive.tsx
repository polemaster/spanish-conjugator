      <p>
        The present subjunctive cannot exist alone. Another element in the
        sentence always causes it to be used. The subjunctive is often needed
        after the following elements.
      </p>

      <h3>Formation of the Present Subjunctive</h3>
      <ul className="ul-list">
        <li>
          Almost all verbs form the present subjunctive from the first-person
          singular <strong>yo</strong> form of the present indicative. Drop the{" "}
          <strong>-o</strong> to get the stem for the present subjunctive.
        </li>
        <li>
          Verbs that are irregular in the present indicative are irregular in
          the present subjunctive in the same way.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are only six verbs that do not form the present subjunctive from
          the <strong>yo</strong> form of the present indicative.
        </li>
        <li>
          Note that the first-person singular and the third-personal singular
          are identical in the present subjunctive.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>
        <em>-Ar</em> Verbs
      </h4>
      <p>
        In order to conjugate both regular and irregular <strong>-ar</strong>{" "}
        verbs in the present subjunctive, you start with the <strong>yo</strong>{" "}
        form of the present indicative. Drop the <strong>-o</strong> and add{" "}
        <strong>-e, -es, -e, -emos, -éis, -en</strong> to the stem.
      </p>

      <h4>
        <em>-Er</em> and <em>-ir</em> Verbs
      </h4>
      <p>
        In order to conjugate both regular and irregular <strong>-er</strong>{" "}
        and <strong>-ir</strong> verbs in the present subjunctive, you drop the{" "}
        <strong>-o</strong> from the first-person singular of the present
        indicative and add <strong>-a, -as, -a, -amos, -áis, -an</strong> to the
        stem.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <small>NOTE</small>: In the irregular <strong>-ir</strong> verbs, there
        is an additional irregularity in the <strong>nosotros</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>vosotros</strong> forms. The stem change <strong>e. ie</strong>{" "}
        or <strong>e. i</strong> has an <strong>-i-</strong> in the{" "}
        <strong>nosotros</strong> and <strong>vosotros</strong> forms. The stem
        change <strong>o. ue</strong> has a <strong>-u-</strong> in the{" "}
        <strong>nosotros</strong> and <strong>vosotros</strong> forms.
      </p>

      <h4>
        <em>-Er</em> and <em>-ir</em> Verbs with <em>-g-</em> or <em>-zc-</em>{" "}
        in the <em>yo</em> Form
      </h4>
      <p>
        In the present subjunctive, certain <strong>-er</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>-ir</strong> verbs carry the irregularity of the first-person
        singular throughout the conjugation. There are no <strong>-ar</strong>{" "}
        verbs that have this irregularity.
      </p>

      <h4>Irregular Verbs</h4>
      <p>
        There are only six verbs that have a present subjunctive that is not
        formed from the first-person singular. They are irregular in that they
        cannot be formed from the <strong>yo</strong> form.
      </p>

      <h4>Verbs with Orthographic Changes</h4>
      <p>
        Verbs with orthographic changes are not irregular. The spelling changes
        simply maintain the sound of the <strong>yo</strong> form. Some of the
        most common spelling changes are the following:
      </p>
      <ul className="ul-list mt-3">
        <li>
          Verbs that end in <strong>-gar</strong> change <strong>g</strong> to{" "}
          <strong>gu</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Verbs that end in <strong>-car</strong> change <strong>c</strong> to{" "}
          <strong>qu</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Verbs that end in <strong>-zar</strong> change <strong>z</strong> to{" "}
          <strong>c</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Uses of the Present Subjunctive</h3>

      <h4>After Certain Impersonal Expressions</h4>
      <p>
        A sentence or question may consist of a main clause and a dependent or
        subordinate clause connected by the Spanish conjunction{" "}
        <strong>que</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is a sentence with a main clause and a subordinate clause in the
        indicative mood.
      </p>
      <img
        className="w-full h-auto rounded-lg shadow-md"
        alt="Images"
        src="src/assets/f0212-01.jpg"
      />

      <h4>After Certain Verbs</h4>
      <h4>Expressing Wishes or Preferences</h4>
      <p>
        Verbs that express wishes or preferences{" "}
        <em>with regard to other people</em> in the main clause will cause the
        subjunctive mood in the dependent clause. The subject in the main clause
        must be different from the subject in the dependent clause.
